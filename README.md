# Heart-Health-Prediction-using-ML
 This Project aims to develop a robust ML model that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease based on various health parameters. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing patient information, including demographic details, medical history, and lifestyle factors, we can build a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.
